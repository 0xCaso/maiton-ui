# Get started

Maiton UI is a components library which will simplify your Frames development, inspired by shadcn.

To start using it, run these commands:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install maiton
npx init maiton
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add maiton
yarn dlx maiton init
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add maiton
pnpx maiton init
```

:::

To install a component, for example `Text`, simply run:

```sh
npx maiton add text
```

You will find the new component in the `/app/frames/components` directory.

Then, you can import it and start using right away.

Check the [text](#TODO) page for some usage examples.
